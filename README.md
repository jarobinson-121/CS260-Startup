# Fortune Finder
## **Description Deliverable**

## Elevator Pitch
Fortune cookies can be quite a lot of fun, but sometimes, you don't need to buy food that you won't eat, simply to see the fun message inside. This website replicates the fun and excitement of opening a fortune cookie, without the wasteful nature of individual wrapping, easily lost slips of paper, and cheap cookies, that many don't actually eat. Plus, you can save a few of your favorite fortunes to keep the fun going!
